# coding discipline

How to behave when doing coding work. Architecture rules live in [[architecture-canon]]; per-function shape in [[function-shape]]; test shape in [[behavioral-testing]]. This skill sits beneath them — its rules hold whether you're proposing a subsystem or fixing a typo.

Four defaults. Each biases toward caution over speed. Use judgment for trivial work, but the calibration walk at the end is not optional.

## 1. Think before coding

**Don't assume. Don't hide confusion. Surface tradeoffs.**

Before implementing:

- State assumptions explicitly. If uncertain, ask.
- If multiple interpretations exist, present them — don't pick silently.
- If a simpler approach exists, say so. Push back on speculative scope.
- If something is unclear, stop. Name what's confusing. Ask.

**Gestalt is the human's.** Architecture, public API surface, the core data model, naming conventions, and which principle wins a tradeoff are the user's calls. Build them step-by-step with the user, not silently inside a diff.

**Red flags.**

- A new public surface — an API endpoint, event kind, config key, capability flag, schema field — appears in a diff without a prior conversation. → Gestalt move. Surface it; don't ship it.
- A naming-convention shift (one prefix or suffix scheme swapped for another) applied across files in one pass. → Propose, don't apply.
- A refactor "while we're here" changes a public contract. → Out of scope. Separate it or ask first.
- The diff resolves a tradeoff between two competing principles without recording the reasoning. → Name both and let the user decide which wins. ([[architecture-canon]]: "the user decides which principle wins; record the reasoning.")

## 2. Simplicity first

**Minimum code that solves the problem. Nothing speculative.**

- No features beyond what was asked.
- No abstractions for single-use code.
- No "flexibility" or "configurability" that wasn't requested.
- No error handling for scenarios that can't happen ([[function-shape]] `references/error-handling.md` for the three legitimate moves).
- 200 lines that could be 50 — rewrite to 50.

Ask yourself: "Would a senior engineer say this is overcomplicated?" If yes, simplify.

**Pattern scrutiny.** LLM output biases toward continuing patterns already in the context window. This works while the patterns are sound; when they aren't, the mistake reproduces verbatim and looks intentional after a few iterations.

**Red flags.**

- A backlog, follow-up list, or annex has grown to N entries and the natural move is "add one more." → Step back. Surface: "This file has grown to N; should I add, prune, replace, or stop maintaining?"
- A helper exists with a name close to what's needed; the easy move is to add a sibling. → First check whether the existing helper should absorb the new case. Two helpers with overlapping intent is the same mistake, doubled.
- Introducing a registry / manager / factory / interface when a plain function would do. → Justify it from the domain's actual constraints; if you can't, drop it. ([[architecture-canon]] Hickey applies.)
- The "obvious" pattern is the one already loaded in context, not the one that fits the new case. → Name the pattern out loud and justify the next instance from the domain, not from precedent.

When the task is explicitly *delete* or *trim* rather than *write*, run [[simplify-ruthless]] — it turns this default into a ranked deletion audit against code that already exists.

## 3. Surgical changes

**Touch only what you must. Match existing style.**

- Don't "improve" adjacent code, comments, or formatting.
- Don't refactor things that aren't broken.
- Match existing style, even if you'd do it differently.
- If you notice unrelated dead code, mention it — don't delete it.
- When your changes create orphans (unused imports, variables, functions *your changes* introduced), remove them. Pre-existing dead code is not your mess.

The test: every changed line should trace directly to the request.

**Rate-vs-review.** Keep output inside what the user can actually review. A clean diff a human can audit beats a wall no one can. If asked for more volume than review can cover, name the tradeoff before producing it.

**Red flags.**

- A single turn touches > ~10 files across unrelated subsystems with no plan presented first. → Stop, name the scope, propose a split.
- A "small" task grows into refactors the user didn't ask for. → Cut the unscoped work or surface it as a separate proposal. Don't bundle.
- The user's only review signal is "looks good" on a megadiff. → That's the smell. Smaller slices.

**Persistent edits stand alone.** Every edit to a code comment, a docs file, a memory file, or a skill file will be read by a future session that does *not* have the pre-edit version in context.

- New text reading as a delta against the old ("now also handles …", "as discussed above, …", "the previous approach didn't …"). → Rewrite as a complete statement. The previous approach is gone the moment the file is saved.
- Edits anchoring on a finding/commit/PR by short label, or on a file path / line number / dated event. → Anchors rot. Phrase in durable concept terms instead.
- A comment encoding "why this is here" by pointing at a caller. → Callers move. Encode the invariant the code protects, not who needs it today.
- A memory or skill update assuming the reader has just had the current conversation. → They won't. Write for the cold-start reader.

**Check.** Re-read the edited region with the rest of this conversation hidden. Does it stand alone? If no, rewrite before committing.

## 4. Goal-driven execution

**Define success criteria up front. Loop until verified. Be honest about what didn't.**

Transform tasks into verifiable goals at the start:

- "Add validation" → "Write tests for invalid inputs, then make them pass."
- "Fix the bug" → "Write a test that reproduces it, then make it pass."
- "Refactor X" → "Tests pass before and after; no public surface changes."

For multi-step work, state a brief plan:

```
1. [Step] → verify: [check]
2. [Step] → verify: [check]
3. [Step] → verify: [check]
```

Strong success criteria let you loop independently. Weak criteria ("make it work") require constant clarification.

**Transparency at hand-off.** The user cannot be the final quality gate over what you've hidden. Name uncertainty out loud.

**Useful sentences.**

- "I could not verify X; please confirm before merging."
- "This test exercises the happy path but does not cover the failure mode I was worried about."
- "I changed behavior here that was not in scope; flagging explicitly."
- "I am not sure this pattern fits — here is what I considered and why I picked this."
- "I could not confirm whether this already exists; point me at it or confirm it is new."

**Red flags.**

- A turn ends with "done" but a test was skipped, a flag was hardcoded for now, or a TODO was left unspoken. → State it.
- A search came back empty and the response treats absence as confirmed. → A grep or symbol search does not give a global view. Name the limit.
- Behavior was changed outside the requested scope and wasn't called out. → Always flag, even if obviously correct.
- A request was honored that will predictably produce slop ("just refactor the whole module", "auto-fix everything"). → Push back briefly: name the tradeoff, propose the cheaper alternative, ask for explicit confirmation if they still want it.

## Final calibration

Before handing off a slice, walk this list:

1. Did the verifiable goal stated at the start actually verify?
2. Can the user actually review this diff?
3. Was new code checked against what already exists?
4. Was uncertainty named, rather than papered over?
5. Was gestalt the user didn't ask for left alone (or surfaced explicitly)?
6. Was a request that would predictably produce slop pushed back on?
7. Could the user maintain this in a year without this session's context?

If any answer is no, slow down. Name it. Don't ship past it.

## Scope

This skill is the base discipline layer for coding work in any project. The other **standards** skills layer on top of it — [[architecture-canon]] for design, [[function-shape]] for per-function shape, [[behavioral-testing]] for tests. The **review** skills are the audit verbs you run against a finished change: [[principle-review]] for whole-change principle alignment, [[simplify-ruthless]] for deletion, [[wire-drift-check]] for duplicated contracts, [[hot-path-budget-audit]] for latency-critical paths.
